Information Visualization: the use of computer-supported, interactive, visual representations of abstract data to amplify cognition[[1](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220691172_Readings_in_Information_Visualization_Using_Vision_To_Think)]

### Diagram of visualization process

the following diagram shows the visualization process

The user can interact with the visualization itself and with the data. And being able to interact with these elements enables the user to answer a number of different questions.

Users can interact with the visual representation by interacting with a computer. So he can change ***what*** is visualized and ***how*** it is visualized.

This enables solving problems with data with **less effort** in a **shorter time** and **more accurate.**

### Why **Visualize** data?

We use visualization to better understanding some phenomena. Who is using visualization and interacting with it has some **goals** refer to a specific phenomena and mental models of **what** this phenomena is and **how** it works.

visualization systems use data, visual representations, and interaction to help people understand some phenomena better.

### Why do we use visualization?

- Explanatory
- Exploratoy
- Confirmatory
